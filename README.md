Goals: 
    Create an Etch A Sketch primarily via JavaScript and
    DOM manipulation.

Pseudocode:
    Create The Grid via DIVs (16x16 by default).
    Upon Mouse Hover, change the color of the div.
    When The Erase Button is clicked, erase the entire grid.
    Prompt The User On A New Grid Size (MAX: 100).
    Loop back to the beginning with new grid size.
