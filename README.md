Goals: 
    Create an Etch A Sketch with elements of
    JavaScript and DOM manipulation integrated.

Pseudocode:
    Create The Grid via DIVs (16x16 by default).
    Upon Mouse Hover, change the color of the div to black.
    When The Erase Button is clicked, erase the entire grid.
    Prompt The User On A New Grid Size (MAX: 100).
    Loop back to the beginning with new grid size.

    OPTIONAL:
        Have each color change be random.
        Subsequent hover overs the same color portion will have 10%
        additional to black. 
        The div will become fully black after 10 passes.
